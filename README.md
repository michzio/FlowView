# FlowView

It is a wizard-like interface. 
A container view that allows the user to navigate through a series of screens or steps, 
with a progress indicator displayed at the top or bottom of the view 
to show the user's current position in the process.

# Usage - Cocoapods 

```
pod 'FlowView'
```

# Usage - Swift Package Manager

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding FlowView as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/michzio/FlowView.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```
